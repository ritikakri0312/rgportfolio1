       <ul>
         <li>
          This portfolio is one of my favorite project which I created using HTML,CSS , CSS grid and JavaScript with Three.js.
          Beautyfied by 3D animated🤖 (backgroung) which brings life🍃 in my website when the page scroll.
         
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
           I chose space 💫 as my project theme.
          Including a (rotating) realistic moon 🌕,bunch of stars 🌟 , beautiful space and a big 3D (rotating) ring 🪐 in backgroung which inhancing the project's charm. I also have an avatar image 👩🏽‍🦱 or a 3D cube which rotates when we scroll our page.
          
          </li>
          <br>

          <li>
            Through this journey  I learned many new concepts like camera📹,lighting💡 and geometry💠 etc.Three.js makes this process 
            very developer friendly 🤝.There is also used a tool which handle all the dependencies of project is "vite".

        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Project 2</h2>
        <h3>Clone of spotify🎧</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed my own music web application like Spotify  or we can call clone 🤡 of spotify  with a beautiful 😎 UI.
            Uses pure  HTML,CSS,JavaScript as front-end
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
                 In this project I am using JavaScripts audio API,like all features are implemented pause(▶) ,play(⏸) previous(⏭),
                 next(⏮),seekbar(〰) etc.We also add the feature of listening as well as uploading the songs 🎶🎧
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            At the back-end I am using Node JS; Database: MongoDB,which helps in retrieving 🛅 data direct from the database📦 and make the wesite dynamically active and helps in picking💼 the data according to user need.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            The agenda of this project is to make spotify subscription free , without ad 📺 and interruption❌ and make the listening happy 💖.
